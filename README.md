Written with Dr. Racket

Within Dr. Racket, I have downloaded the "sicp" package, which is a Scheme implementation suited for the Scheme dialect used in the famous computer science book "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs". 

The said book was used as the introduction to cs book in MIT, Berkeley, etc. for many years. And many of the examples in this repository of mine were inspired by that book. All the glory to the computer science legends!
